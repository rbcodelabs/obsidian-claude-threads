/**
 * Tests for ThreadManager's per-thread session bookkeeping under the
 * single-map ThreadSession model (ADR-0002 Stage 2).
 *
 * This file used to test the two-map "lingering session" design
 * (`sessions` + `lingeringSessions`, `LINGER_MAX_MS`, `unwindLingeringSession()`)
 * that existed because the old per-turn `ClaudeSession` model could end up
 * with a session whose first `result` had landed (thread looks idle) but
 * whose `run()` hadn't resolved yet — a second `ClaudeSession` could then be
 * constructed for the SAME thread while the first was still draining,
 * racing it for the CLI's stdin. `unwindLingeringSession()`'s own force
 * `endInput()`/`close()` on that first session — independent of whether a
 * permission request was in flight — was itself the second, previously
 * unguarded root cause of the "Stream closed" bug class documented in
 * ADR-0002's "Context" section.
 *
 * ADR-0002 Stage 2 removes the premise entirely: `ThreadManager.sessions`
 * is now a single `Map<string, ThreadSession>`, one long-lived session per
 * thread for its whole lifetime. There is no second map, no linger timer,
 * and — because a thread's session is looked up-or-created synchronously
 * with no `await` before it's stored in the map (see `sendMessage()`'s doc
 * comment) — never a second `ThreadSession` instance to race for the same
 * thread's stdin. `isRunning()` is a plain `session.turnInFlight` read.
 *
 * This file is the single highest-value rewrite in the migration: it is
 * testing the exact bug class the whole ADR exists to fix. The main
 * regression test below reproduces the specific bug Stage C's rewrite of
 * `onInterrupted` fixed: rolling back only the trailing pending user message
 * (matching a single closure-captured id, safe under the old "at most one
 * unresolved message" invariant) is not enough once `sendMessage()` no
 * longer gates on "busy" — two or more user messages can be unresolved at
 * once, and ALL of them must be rolled back on interrupt, not just the last.
