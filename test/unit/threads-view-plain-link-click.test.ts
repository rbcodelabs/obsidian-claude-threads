/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * Regression tests for "inline links in the conversation from Codex/Claude
 * don't work — clicking does nothing":
 *
 *  Root cause 1: a rendered markdown link whose href is an OS-absolute path
 *  that happens to fall under the vault root (e.g.
 *  `/Users/rick/Documents/Personal/Products/Geode/Runs/foo.md`) was passed
 *  straight through to ContextPanelController.openLinkText / the classic
 *  openLinkText call, both of which expect vault-relative linktext — so the
 *  lookup silently failed and nothing happened. Fixed by resolving such
 *  hrefs through resolveAbsoluteVaultHref() before opening.
 *
 *  Root cause 2: in classic placement (the default — threadViewPlacement
 *  defaults to 'classic' in src/types.ts), no click listener was ever
 *  attached to plain `[label](path)` links at all — the handler bailed out
 *  immediately via `if (!this.plugin.isConversationFirst() || ...) return`.
 *  Only conversation-first mode got a working handler. Fixed by attaching
 *  the listener unconditionally and branching on isConversationFirst()
 *  *inside* the handler, mirroring the existing a.internal-link handler.
 *
 * ThreadsView is a full Obsidian ItemView; this suite instantiates it via
 * Object.create(ThreadsView.prototype) (see threads-view-focus.test.ts for
 * the established pattern) so renderMarkdown() can be exercised directly
 * against real jsdom nodes without standing up the full view lifecycle.
