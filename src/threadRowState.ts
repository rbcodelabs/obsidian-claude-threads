/**
 * threadRowState.ts
 *
 * Shared classification for "what bucket does this thread belong in" —
 * extracted so AgentDashboard, KanbanView, and the ThreadsView thread
 * switcher panel (previously three independently hand-rolled partition
 * loops) agree on the exact same precedence rules.
 *
 * This does NOT replace `computeUiStatus` in ObsidianTools.ts — that's a
 * separate, coarser, external-facing vocabulary (5 states, no
 * waiting/awaiting distinction) with its own vocabulary-consistency test.
 * This module is strictly for the three view-layer duplicates.
 *
 * Priority order (highest first), matching the precedent already present in
 * the pre-refactor inline implementations (see kanban-bucketing.test.ts —
 * "waiting" is already checked before "error", etc.):
 *
 *   1. hasPendingPermission → 'awaiting' (including restored question/plan state)
 *   2. isRunning            → 'running'
 *   3. hasActiveBackgroundTasks → 'running' (folds into the existing Working
 *      bucket per product decision — a thread with no active foreground turn
 *      but an outstanding background task/subagent/workflow is still "doing
 *      something," it just isn't the caller's own turn anymore)
 *   4. hasPendingWakeup     → 'waiting'
 *   5. lastError            → 'error'
 *   6. messageCount > 0     → 'idle-reviewed' if reviewed, else 'idle-new'
 *   7. else                 → 'empty'
